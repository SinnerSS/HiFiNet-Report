In this section, we evaluated our proposed method against other methods in the literature. From previous research about fault diagnosis in WSNs, we selected Support Vector Machine(SVM), Deep Belief Network \cite{Prasad2023}, and LSTM Classifier.

\subsection{Dataset}
For purpose of fault detection, we created an original dataset using data from NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis data (Temperature at 2 Meter) as substitution for measurements taken from a WSN. The data is collected from the North Vietnam region from a period of roughly 6 months. Another dataset used for performance evaluation is the Intel Lab Dataset. This dataset comprises readings from a network of 54 sensor nodes, specifically Mica2Dot devices, which were outfitted with environmental sensing capabilities. These nodes systematically captured time-stamped information relating to ambient conditions, including temperature, humidity, light levels, and the sensors' own voltage. The data acquisition process occurred at intervals of roughly 31 seconds for each sensor. The collection period for this particular dataset extended from late February 2004 through early April 2004 \cite{Intel2004}.
